# LinkedIn Post: Azure Migration Guide

---

🚀 **Just published a complete beginner's guide to migrating applications to Azure!**

Are you new to DevOps and cloud computing? Feeling overwhelmed by terms like Kubernetes, Container Registry, and GitOps? 

I've created a step-by-step guide that walks you through migrating a real-world microservices application (Product Catalog & Ratings App) to Azure using **only the web interface** - no command-line expertise required! 

**What you'll learn:**
✅ Set up Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
✅ Configure Azure DevOps pipelines with self-hosted build agents
✅ Implement GitOps with ArgoCD for automated deployments
✅ Deploy a complete microservices architecture (4 services + MongoDB + Redis)
✅ Build a full CI/CD pipeline from code push to production

**Perfect for beginners** - Every step includes screenshots and clear explanations using Azure Portal's user-friendly UI.

This migration project covers everything from infrastructure setup to automated deployments, giving you hands-on experience with modern DevOps practices.
